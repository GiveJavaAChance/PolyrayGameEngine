# Contributing to Polyray

Hey! First of all, huge thanks for checking out this engine, and even bigger thanks if you're considering contributing!

This engine has been a solo project for a long time, but it's starting to grow, and I'd love to see where the community can take it.

If you've got ideas, improvements, or just fixes, just fork the repo, try things out, and make a pull request when you're ready, and if you're stuck, just open a discussion or issue. I'm always down to help if I have time.

You can check the README for upcoming features.

Thanks again for being part of this, it really means a lot!
